online. In order for a user to sell bitcoins they (`seller`) must store
the bitcoins in the *#{BOT_NAME}*  web wallet belonging to their account from where the bitcoins are transferred to the user
purchasing the bitcoins (`buyer`) after the seller confirms
the buyers payment.

All trades on this site are conducted between users of the service. *#{BOT_NAME}*  may help to resolve disputes between buyers and sellers. Acting as an escrow provider, *#{BOT_NAME}* is not itself a party of any bitcoin trade or transactions conducted by its users.
